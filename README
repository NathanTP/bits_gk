BITS Gatekeeper

A tool for selecting an optimal subset of benchmarks to include in a suite.

== Features ==
ref-cycles - These are constant-speed cycles (at 100Mhz) and can be used as to
             measure real-time spent by the application.

branches - These are the number of branching instructions issued (think if/else)

branch-misses - The number of times the CPU mis-predicted which way a branch
                would go.

instructions - The number of instructions (basic steps) issued.

cpu-cycles - The true number of cycles spent. This can change based on
             temperature or other reasons out of our control.

L1-dcache-load-misses - The number of times a piece of data was not in the first
                        level of cache.

L1-dcache-load - The number of data words fetched from the L1

L1-icache-load-misses - The number of instructions missed in the L1

dTLB-load-misses - Number of times a page was not in the TLB.

dTLB-loads - Number of times the TLB was referenced (inclusive with L1-dcache).

LLC-load-misses - Misses in the last level cache (data and instructions).

syscalls:sys_enter* - Number of times each system call was issued

== Derived Features ==
These stats are combinations of the above of particular interest. They are not
explictly stated in the data but might be interesting to extract.

IPC - Instructions / Cycle ('instructions' / 'cpu-cycles'). A common metric used
      to evaluate CPUs. Range from 0-4 on the test machine (1 is typical).

Miss-Rate - %cache misses ('L1-dcache-load' / 'L1-dcache-load-misses'). Probably
            more informative than raw miss count (since different programs issue
            different numbers of loads.

XdTLB_hit = Exclusive TLB hits. Basically removing the affect of the L1.
            (dTLB-loads - dTLB_load_misses) - (L1_dcache_load - L1_dcache_load_misses)

XdTLB-Miss-Rate - Exclusive TLB miss rate. ('dTLB-load-misses' / 'xdTLB_hit')
